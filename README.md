# SPAAAAAAAAACE@PSHS - 5th Kibo Robot Programming Competition

---

*\*is this microphone on..? OH!\** hey, children

this is your local year 12 speaking

...this is just a temporary readme file for later use when the project actually starts or smth

for now though, this branch of the repo is empty (i hope you know what that means). you'll have to switch over to the other branch to find all the demo stuff from last year's competition guidelines and resources

lol :)
